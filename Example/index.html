        <h1>Reusable Network Viz Demo</h1>
        <p> 
            Oh hey there! The visualization below was built using the network module. You can find the documentation in the README.md and example usage in main.js. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Alright, quick intro time! Let's get some terminology down. Nodes are the circles in the graph. Links are the lines between them. Labels are the letters on the circles. I'm assuming you know what stroke and fill are for SVG elements (Otherwise, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes" target="_blank">Strokes and Fills</a>). You now understand what the different properties of the chart control. For a complete list, look at the README.
        </p>
        
        <p class="instructions">
            Try dragging nodes around!
        </p>

        <!-- This is the div that the visualization is bound to.-->
        <div id="vis"></div>

        <p>
            There are two types of data being visualized. First, which nodes are present, and second, which of these are related. </p>
        <p>
            The first is represented as a list of node objects. The second is represented  as pairs of IDs of the nodes.  
            The data passed in needs to be of the following JSON format. This is a sample of the data for which the graph above was built. For the complete data you can look at data.json
